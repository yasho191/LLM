0	This afternoon, I spoke to former President George W. Bush.
0	Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance.
0	We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio.
0	And it took more time after that for it to start working.
0	In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days.
0	I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
0	Every American who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from Lexington to Gettysburg ; from Iwo Jima to Inchon ; from Khe Sanh to Kandahar --
0	If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice—but it is not the change we need.
0	I mean, I helped, but -- (applause.)
0	The work of democracy has always been hard.
0	So, you see, that's what our democracy demands.
0	And may God bless the United States of America, and all who serve her.
0	Today, old adversaries are at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners.
0	But remember, none of this happens on its own.
0	And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.
0	It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy, and organizing, and alliance-building, and deal-making, and the changing of public opinion.
0	Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years.
0	That's how progress happens -- in societies and in our own lives.
0	And it's not just my belief.
0	I've been living it.
0	And despite the costs involved, America's commitment will not weaken.
0	To my remarkable staff : For 8 years—and for some of you , a whole lot more—I have drawn from your energy , and every day I tried to
0	This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
0	And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement.
0	When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk.
0	And success, however small, however incomplete, success is still success.
0	Four years ago , I stood before you and told you my story—of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who
0	They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach.
0	So, Class of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be.
0	That's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights: to expand democracy and human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights.
0	We’ve doubled the production of clean energy.
0	For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
0	The Holy Koran tells us: "O mankind!
0	As we do, I’m mindful that the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home.
0	Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism, it is an important part of promoting peace.
0	And to all who serve or have served, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your Commander in Chief.
0	And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race , religion , or station in life , all of us share common aspirations to
0	We all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do ; that they value hard work
0	It determines what policies they prioritize.
0	Together with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own , our troops fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better
0	But I will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better
0	But in the days to come, it must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as President.
0	Let me tell you, you're not the only ones.
0	Qualities like kindness and compassion, honesty, hard work -- they often matter more than technical skills or know-how.
0	I’m confident that you can make the right choices -- away from fear and division and paralysis, and toward cooperation and innovation and hope.
0	Don't be scared to take somebody on.
0	And that is why we will support them everywhere.
0	We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the Inquisition.
0	I'll invest in early childhood education.
0	We have the power to make the world we seek , but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning , keeping in mind what has
0	Nor can I answer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to this point.
0	It's time for us to change America.
0	Which brings me to my third point:  Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science -- these are good things.
0	This moment—this election—is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.
0	Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.
0	I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors
0	That's just not knowing what you're talking about.
0	to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth."
0	I always tell my daughters, you know, better is good.
0	I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.
0	To the love of my life , our next First Lady , Michelle Obama , and to Sasha and Malia—I love you so much , and I 'm so
0	Americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9/11.
0	It's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.
0	That's how we banned child labor.
0	And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against
0	Now , there is no straight line to realize this promise , but this much is clear : Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable , successful
0	I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story.
0	Why would we want to stop it now?
0	The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart , or whether we commit ourselves to an effort , a sustained effort to find
0	Now, I say all these things not to make you complacent.
0	The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
0	And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress , he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our
0	That's the economic argument.
0	They could've heard words of anger and discord.
0	And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires.
0	AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Because of you!
0	Of course, the soldiers left much behind.
0	Our unity at home was tested.
0	To Joe Biden , the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware 's favorite son , you were the first decision I made as a nominee , and it
0	We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a
0	Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
0	But I say it to point out that change has been a constant in our history.
0	And the good news is that today the economy is growing again.
0	It wasn’t because the facts and the evidence showed they wouldn't work.
0	But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations , it betrays the essential spirit of this country , the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving
0	Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps—even if you don't have boots.
0	And by doing so, you’ll strengthen your own position, and you’ll hone your arguments.
0	Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.
0	And when that government is in place, there should be no doubt:  The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States.
0	Fortunately, your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future.
0	We are shaped by every culture , drawn from every end of the Earth , and dedicated to a simple concept : E pluribus unum— '' Out of many
0	So let us agree that patriotism has no party.
0	I agree, our trade should be fair and not just free.
0	Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses ; and the time to protect Social Security for
0	That is why there is a mosque in every State in our Union and over 1,200 mosques within our borders.
0	If we 're unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants , just because they do n't look like us , we will diminish the prospects of our own
0	That's why we honor Bill Moyers or Dr. Burnell.
0	Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace , and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such
0	And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country : You , more than anyone , have the ability to reimagine the
0	It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength."
0	And yet , Al Qaida chose to ruthlessly murder these people , claimed credit for the attack , and even now states their determination to kill on a massive
0	And he’s a senator!
0	And you have made the country proud.
0	It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.
0	And because of our drawdown in Iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense.
0	America, this is one of those moments.
0	It's not because John McCain doesn't care.
0	You can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.
0	The beginning of this century has been one of those times.
0	Here in New Brunswick , you can debate philosophy with a classmate from South Asia in one class , and then strike up a conversation on the EE Bus
0	These are qualities you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens.
0	This is a sacred trust.
0	And this is important , because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground , nor can it be sustained while young people
0	Make them defend their positions.
0	And I 've said and I mean it : If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we 've made to our health
0	As I’ve said, there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed it.
0	And we got to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they’re talking about.
0	For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11 , I stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us
0	So you have to stick with it.
0	It's good to be home!
0	It's not because I wasn’t proposing them.
0	Now, much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President.
0	The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
0	Because I know our work has not only helped so many Americans , it has inspired so many Americans , especially so many young people out there , to
0	Our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to Iraq’s future is not.
0	ISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe.
0	Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
0	It is that spirit , born of the Enlightenment , that made us an economic powerhouse : the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral ,
0	Progress doesn’t travel in a straight line.
0	For over a thousand years , Al-Azhar has stood as a beacon of Islamic learning , and for over a century , Cairo University has been a source of
0	Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
0	The President: I can't do that.
0	One of the newest members of the Big Ten.
0	It is time for these settlements to stop.
0	This is the hope of all humanity.
0	We must always examine the ways in which we protect it.
0	And, Class of 2016, it is your turn now -- (applause) -- to shape our nation’s destiny, as well as your own.
0	Point number one:  When you hear someone longing for the “good old days,” take it with a grain of salt.
0	Indeed, none of us should tolerate these extremists.
0	Too much blood has been shed.
0	Throughout our history , a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom , and more opportunity ,
0	Politicians care about being elected, and they especially care about being reelected.
0	And ultimately, that's how we help raise wages here in America.
0	Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur.
0	Meanwhile, in the eight years since most of you started high school, we’re also better off.
0	Because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform , because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support our troops , no
0	And every day, I have learned from you.
0	It's easier to start wars than to end them.
0	So let there be no doubt, Islam is a part of America.
0	It 's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours—a promise that has led
0	You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom.
0	You must maintain your power through consent , not coercion ; you must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise ; you
0	Along with nearly 1.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq, they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew.
0	And next August, we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility.
0	I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions.
0	We will disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda, while preventing Afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists.
0	THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that's nice.
0	It ain’t so.
0	And that is, gear yourself for the long haul.
0	Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
0	That promise is our greatest inheritance.
0	And as it turned out , America was n't weakened by the presence of these newcomers ; these newcomers embraced this Nation 's creed , and this Nation was
0	But I guess it 's part of human nature , especially in times of change and uncertainty , to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past
0	Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
0	You have shown what history teaches us—that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
0	That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans, who are just as patriotic as we are.
0	The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America , but its promise exists for all who come to our shores , and
0	I mean, listen, climate change is not something subject to political spin.
0	There have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity.
0	We ’ ve persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war , a new beginning could
0	In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796 , our second President , John Adams , wrote : `` The United States has in itself no character of enmity
0	I come here for a simple reason -- to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor ham question.
0	These are the Americans that I know.
0	But what the people heard instead—people of every creed and color, from every walk of life—is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
0	For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression.
0	That's not the judgment we need.
0	It is that promise that has always set this country apart—that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together
0	I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.
0	More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.
0	It falls to each of us to be those anxious , jealous guardians of our democracy ; to embrace the joyous task we 've been given to continually try
0	We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home , if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and now Pakistan determined
0	The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives—on health care and education and the economy—Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
0	In an age without surrender ceremonies, we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation.
0	But for all the real progress that we've made, we know it's not enough.
0	I 've seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and ,
0	The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai.
0	No matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem, that's part of defending America.
0	And today , as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration ,
0	Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort, that we are fated to disagree and civilizations are doomed to clash.
0	Mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers on your cheesesteaks -- (applause.)
0	I’m sure Michelle would approve.
0	And I hope your faith has, too.
0	We’re less dependent on foreign oil.
0	In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them.
0	America, we are better than these last eight years.
0	And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.
0	That is the world we seek, but we can only achieve it together.
0	But I also believe that the arc of our nation , the arc of the world does not bend towards justice , or freedom , or equality , or
0	Which brings me to my final point: Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted.
0	And it is that promise that forty five years ago today , brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington ,
0	The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear.
0	That’s how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values -- including human rights.
0	Make no mistake, we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan.
0	The question now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.
0	If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
0	Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build.
0	But we have also understood that our nation’s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home.
0	We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President—when the average American family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead
0	(The wind starts blowing hard.)
0	This is a place where you 3D-print prosthetic hands for children, and devise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean, renewable energy.
0	The Holy Koran teaches that "whoever kills an innocent" is as—"it is as if he has killed all mankind."
0	And that's why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons.
0	America is no fragile thing, but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.
0	Six million Jews were killed, more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today.
0	Sometimes you took half a loaf.
0	I know it's getting cold and you guys have to graduate.
0	The market will fix it.
0	The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals.
0	Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people.
0	Now, it's true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year.
0	Ending this war is not only in Iraq’s interest -- it’s in our own.
0	Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?
0	We, the people, give it meaning with our participation and with the choices that we make and the alliances that we forge.
0	Now, I don't think it's a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice and the previous administration.
0	And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.
0	And the reason America is better is because we didn’t look backwards we didn’t fear the future.
0	And so at this moment , as we wind down the war in Iraq , we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy , and grit
0	I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts.
0	Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women.
0	You’re not only better educated, you’ve been more exposed to the world, more exposed to other cultures.
0	I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.
0	So you’ve got the tools to lead us.
0	Denying that fact is baseless, it is ignorant, and it is hateful.
0	Likewise , it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit , for instance , by dictating what clothes a
0	There ’ s not much I ’ m afraid to take on in my final year of office , but I know better than to get in the middle
0	Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year.
0	It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
0	This too is part of America's promise—the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
0	It 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American
0	What a radical idea , a great gift that our Founders gave to us : The freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat and toil and imagination
0	And Iraqi forces have taken the fight to al Qaeda, removing much of its leadership in Iraqi-led operations.
0	And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.
0	We cannot walk alone.
0	Look, I'm not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately more important in life than passion, or faith, or love, or loyalty.
0	It won't boost our economy, and it won’t enhance our security either.
0	If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority , then workers of all shades are going to be
0	But , contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right , the system isn ’ t as rigged as you think ,
0	From this desk, seven and a half years ago, President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq.
0	And like all Americans, I’m awed by their sacrifice, and by the sacrifices of their families.
0	You believe in a fair and just and inclusive America.
1	But new threats also require new thinking.
1	Graduates of this academy have brought creativity and courage to every field of endeavor.
1	And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.
1	Some scientists believe that one source of these cures might be embryonic stem cell research.
1	Building this just peace is America's opportunity, and America's duty.
1	In the long run , the most realistic way to protect the American people is to provide a hopeful alternative to the hateful ideology of the enemy , by
1	Our schools will have higher expectations.
1	Thanks for coming, Roscoe.
1	Our troops will have a well-defined mission : to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods , to help them protect the local population , and to help ensure that
1	In earlier operations, political and sectarian interference prevented Iraqi and American forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence.
1	Not feel-good methods, not sound-good methods, but methods that actually work.
1	But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror , that your children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that
1	I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image.
1	And our security will require all Americans to be forward-looking and resolute , to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our
1	I believe that it will.
1	For much of the last century, America's defense relied on the Cold War doctrines of deterrence and containment.
1	I don't intend to read it all.
1	Under the policy I announced five years ago , my administration became the first to make federal funds available for this research , yet only on embryonic stem cell
1	This is an important piece of legislation.
1	And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.
1	We believe strongly -- we believe strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people.
1	If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.
1	And the folks at the Crawford Coffee Shop -- (laughter) -- would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow.
1	And we concluded that to step back now would force a collapse of the Iraqi government , tear the country apart , and result in mass killings on an
1	Because the war on terror will require resolve and patience, it will also require firm moral purpose.
1	Eighty percent of Iraq's sectarian violence occurs within 30 miles of the capital.
1	Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.
1	Parents will have more information about the schools, and more say in how their children are educated.
1	We have faced danger and trial, and there's more ahead.
1	It makes no sense to say that you 're in favor of finding cures for terrible diseases as quickly as possible , and then block a bill that would
1	Thank you all for coming and may God bless.
1	America will change our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet these benchmarks.
1	In tyranny, they suffer.
1	This is a good bill for the American children, and I'm proud to sign it in their presence.
1	They remind us of what is lost when embryos are destroyed in the name of research.
1	And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of federal funding for scientifically-based early reading programs.
1	I want to thank you all for coming.
1	We fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors human liberty.
1	They also report that this plan can work.
1	In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad.
1	Every school has a job to do.
1	This good man was 60 years old—18 years above the age limit.
1	My policy has allowed us to explore the potential of embryonic stem cells, and it has allowed America to continue to lead the world in this area.
1	America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.
1	Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.
1	Competition between great nations is inevitable, but armed conflict in our world is not.
1	Reaching this moment has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner's discussion.
1	The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it.
1	We want you to have as much flexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom can succeed.
1	In this situation, action is clearly necessary.
1	Recently, local tribal leaders have begun to show their willingness to take on al Qaeda.
1	Now, as then, they seek to impose a joyless conformity, to control every life and all of life.
1	West Point is guided by tradition , and in honor of the `` Golden Children of the Corps , '' -- ( applause ) -- I will observe one
1	And Secretary Rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in Baghdad to ensure better results for economic assistance being spent in Iraq.
1	The legislation Congress passed today addresses this problem head on by providing a variety of new tools to the government -- such as allowing us to purchase some of
1	This will be done as expeditiously as possible, but it cannot be accomplished overnight.
1	And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.
1	Toward the end of his life, Dwight Eisenhower recalled the first day he stood on the plain at West Point.
1	For example, a skin cell to function like an embryonic stem cell.
1	These young Americans understand that our cause in Iraq is noble and necessary -- and that the advance of freedom is the calling of our time.
1	The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achieve standards, to meet the standards.
1	But for it to succeed, our commanders say the Iraqis will need our help.
1	We've got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teach what works.
1	But the stakes for America are never small.
1	I 'm told that plebes , when asked whom they outrank , are required to answer this : `` Sir , the Superintendent 's dog -- ( laughter )
1	Honorable people have different views, and they will voice their criticisms.
1	It's a great symbol of what is possible in Washington when good people come together to do what's right.
1	It establishes a bipartisan board to oversee the plan's implementation.
1	These bills illustrate both the promise and perils we face in the age of biotechnology.
1	On one side are those who believe in freedom and moderation.
1	This legislation would overturn the balanced policy on embryonic stem cell research that my administration has followed for the past five years.
1	I 'm especially grateful for the contributions of Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Minority Leader John Boehner , Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , Minority Whip Roy Blunt , Chairman Barney
1	The bill I sign today upholds these humane ideals and draws an important ethical line to guide our research.
1	It's up to you, the citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is left behind.
1	I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended.
1	From this day forward, all students will have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their dreams.
1	The situation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people -- and it is unacceptable to me.
1	These two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory to move in and out of Iraq.
1	This bill would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of finding medical benefits for others.
1	Congress has just passed and sent to my desk two bills concerning the use of stem cells in biomedical research.
1	And we owe the children of America a good education.
1	This time , Iraqi and American forces will have a green light to enter those neighborhoods -- and Prime Minister Maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will
1	You walk in the tradition of Eisenhower and MacArthur, Patton and Bradley - the commanders who saved a civilization.
1	Our troops in Iraq have fought bravely.
1	No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance.
1	And there's no mystery to this achievement.
1	The work ahead is difficult.
1	Many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not.
1	The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.
1	And I thank you for the countless acts of courage, generosity, and grace that I have witnessed these past eight years.
1	And above all, I thank the American people for the trust you have given me.
1	It has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your President.
1	When these forces are fully deployed, there will be 18 Iraqi Army and National Police brigades committed to this effort, along with local police.
1	Our military forces in Anbar are killing and capturing al Qaeda leaders, and they are protecting the local population.
1	But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.
1	That's not right in America.
1	I believe America's scientists have the ingenuity and skill to meet this challenge.
1	We are in a conflict between good and evil, and America will call evil by its name.
1	But we have been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them.
1	Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to terrorist allies.
1	America, at its best, is also courageous.
1	Even if our new strategy works exactly as planned, deadly acts of violence will continue -- and we must expect more Iraqi and American casualties.
1	And we will defend the peace that makes all progress possible.
1	This is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom.
1	America has never been united by blood or birth or soil.
1	We're going to spend more on our schools, and we're going to spend it more wisely.
1	Targeting innocent civilians for murder is always and everywhere wrong.
1	But there can be little debate about the results.
1	The bill also ensures that these new programs are carried out in a way that protects taxpayers.
1	And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any other—citizen of the United States of America.
1	Victory will not look like the ones our fathers and grandfathers achieved.
1	We see it in Julio Medina, a former inmate who leads a faith-based program to help prisoners returning to society.
1	They are living proof that effective medical science can also be ethical.
1	I appreciate so very much my friend, Judd Gregg, from the state of New Hampshire, being here.
1	Now, as then, our enemies are totalitarians, holding a creed of power with no place for human dignity.
1	She said, "I don't ever remember taking an exam.
1	When it comes to the common rights and needs of men and women, there is no clash of civilizations.
1	In the days ahead, my national security team will fully brief Congress on our new strategy.
1	I want to thank George Miller.
1	Senator Mike DeWine of your state of Ohio , who helped author -- ( applause ) -- who helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this
1	So today, I'm keeping the promise I made to the American people by returning this bill to Congress with my veto.
1	And now it 's up to you , the local citizens of our great land , the compassionate , decent citizens of America , to stand up and demand
1	Since I announced my policy in 2001, advances in scientific research have also shown the great potential of stem cells that are derived without harming human embryos.
1	And they are looking at Iraq.
1	For the safety of our people, America must succeed in Iraq.
1	Now is the time to act.
1	Generations of West Point officers planned and practiced for battles with Soviet Russia.
1	But it's just the beginning of change.
1	These troops will work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their formations.
1	And this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations.
1	We see that value in the children who are with us today.
1	I look forward to singing Judd 's praises because he is a solid , solid United States senator -- honest , full of integrity , and like the others
1	Our enemies in Iraq will make every effort to ensure that our television screens are filled with images of death and suffering.
1	It will take more time and determined effort to get through this difficult period.
1	May God bless this house and our next President.
1	In that box is the bill.
1	Our security will require transforming the military you will lead -- a military that must be ready to strike at a moment 's notice in any dark corner of
1	West Point produced the chief engineer of the Panama Canal, the mind behind the Manhattan Project, the first American to walk in space.
1	The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act was sponsored by Senators Santorum and Brownback -- both who are here.
1	Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea.
1	Our past efforts to secure Baghdad failed for two principal reasons : There were not enough Iraqi and American troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists
1	A truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of dissent for all groups that pursue their aspirations without violence.
1	This fine institution gave us the man they say invented baseball, and other young men over the years who perfected the game of football.
1	We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.
1	Our security will require the best intelligence, to reveal threats hidden in caves and growing in laboratories.
1	To establish its authority, the Iraqi government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's provinces by November.
1	This is a strong commitment.
1	It is fair to hold our views up to scrutiny.
1	May you always bring to that duty the high standards of this great American institution.
1	We're going to win the war overseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home, as well.
1	We also need to examine ways to mobilize talented American civilians to deploy overseas , where they can help build democratic institutions in communities and nations recovering from war
1	Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right.
1	So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq.
1	I probably won't be sharing that with the Secretary of the Navy.
1	It crosses a moral boundary that our decent society needs to respect, so I vetoed it.
1	Americans should also expect that it will take some time for this legislation to have its full impact on our economy.
1	There 's no greater challenge than to make sure that every child -- and all of us on this stage mean every child , not just a few children
1	He did a fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington.
1	Under one, a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology, condemns women to subservience, and marks unbelievers for murder.
1	Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.
1	President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country.
1	All of the chaos and suffering they caused came at much less than the cost of a single tank.
1	Lieutenant Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight , because he will soon deploy to Iraq , where he will help save America 's wounded warriors—and uphold the legacy
1	And I still carry his badge.
1	He is a fabulous United States senator.
1	Their solution is to scale back America's efforts in Baghdad -- or announce the phased withdrawal of our combat forces.
1	And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.
1	Officers graduating that year helped fulfill that mission, defeating Japan and Germany, and then reconstructing those nations as allies.
1	But the truth of the matter is our schools will flourish when citizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind.
1	Some of you followed in the path of the imperfect graduate , Ulysses S. Grant , who had his fair share of demerits , and said the happiest day
1	Yours is indeed a noble profession.
1	The gravest danger to freedom lies at the perilous crossroads of radicalism and technology.
1	We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best.
1	And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.
1	In time, they will find that social and political freedom is the only true source of national greatness.
1	They serve far from their families, who make the quiet sacrifices of lonely holidays and empty chairs at the dinner table.
1	You graduate from this Academy in a time of war, taking your place in an American military that is powerful and is honorable.
1	From Afghanistan to Lebanon to the Palestinian Territories , millions of ordinary people are sick of the violence , and want a future of peace and opportunity for their
1	There have been good days and tough days.
1	And America owes you a debt of gratitude.
1	In this way our struggle is similar to the Cold War.
1	We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.
1	And the federal bench includes wise new members like Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.
1	And we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq.
1	They blew up one of the holiest shrines in Shia Islam -- the Golden Mosque of Samarra -- in a calculated effort to provoke Iraq 's Shia population to
1	In every corner of America, the words "West Point" command immediate respect.
1	I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor.
1	And so the new role of the federal government is to set high standards , provide resources , hold people accountable , and liberate school districts to meet the
1	It prevents failed executives from receiving windfalls from taxpayers' dollars.
1	This is the belief that gave birth to our nation.
1	And this nation will act.
1	The Senate passed the same legislation on Wednesday night.
1	And so, my fellow Americans, for the final time: Good night.
1	Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.
1	And all four of these members up here need to be proud of the legacy they have left behind.
1	The elections of 2005 were a stunning achievement.
1	Five days from now, the world will witness the vitality of American democracy.
1	So America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad.
1	Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country , it is the inborn hope of our humanity , an ideal we carry but do not own
1	We will help the Iraqis build a larger and better-equipped army , and we will accelerate the training of Iraqi forces , which remains the essential U.S. security mission
1	And all involved have a responsibility to explain how the path they propose would be more likely to succeed.
1	As we address these challenges—and others we cannot foresee tonight—America must maintain our moral clarity.
1	America pursues medical advances in the name of life, and we will achieve the great breakthroughs we all seek with reverence for the gift of life.
1	I felt like crossing this line would be a mistake, and once crossed, we would find it almost impossible to turn back.
1	When challenges to our prosperity emerged, we rose to meet them.
1	Our war on terror is only begun, but in Afghanistan it was begun well.
1	At a moment when ethical alternatives are becoming available , we can not lose the opportunity to conduct research that would give hope to those suffering from terrible diseases
1	I know you all are anxious to get back to class.
1	A short time ago, the House of Representatives passed a bill that is essential to helping America's economy weather the financial crisis.
1	Today, your last day at West Point, you begin a life of service in a career unlike any other.
1	We will work for a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.
1	A major problem in our financial system is that banks have restricted the flow of credit to businesses and consumers ; many of the assets these banks are holding
1	And I'm signing this bill here because it's the home of the Chairman, John Boehner.
1	And our society is better off because you decided to teach.
1	This new strategy will not yield an immediate end to suicide bombings, assassinations, or IED attacks.
1	Brutality against women is always and everywhere wrong.
1	I want to thank the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his leadership.
1	Through most of history, poverty was persistent, inescapable, and almost universal.
1	Thank you for letting us come.
1	Al Qaeda is still active in Iraq.
1	But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two of them there can be no compromise.
1	His son, Nathan—a Marine—gave his life in Iraq.
1	In keeping with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group , we will increase the embedding of American advisers in Iraqi Army units , and partner a coalition brigade
1	I have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families.
1	It sets a grand goal for the country.
1	Germany fought France , the Axis fought the Allies , and then the East fought the West , in proxy wars and tense standoffs , against a backdrop of
1	If we've learned anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a good school.
1	This new approach comes after consultations with Congress about the different courses we could take in Iraq.
1	I still invited him to come with me.
1	And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.
1	Every child must be taught these principles.
1	As the years passed, most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11.
1	In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise.
1	More state and local governments will be able to fund basic services.
1	Unfortunately, Congress has sent me a bill that fails to meet this ethical test.
1	To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis.
1	America was founded on the principle that we are all created equal, and endowed by our Creator with the right to life.
1	Across our country, students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools.
1	With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.
1	Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next.
1	But we made it, because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what was right for America.
1	Some people argue that finding new cures for disease requires the destruction of human embryos like the ones that these families adopted.
1	This bill would also undermine the principle that Congress , itself , has followed for more than a decade , when it has prohibited federal funding for research that
1	Thank you very much, General Lennox.
1	Most of Iraq's Sunni and Shia want to live together in peace -- and reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation possible.
1	The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.
1	Yet the war on terror will not be won on the defensive.
1	I want a West Point football player."
1	So now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good results.
1	When this happens , daily life will improve , Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders , and the government will have the breathing space it needs to make
2	Nor do we exaggerate when we say Saddam Hussein will fail.
2	And thank you very, very much from a grateful people.
2	And listen to what they say, for they've said it better than any President or Prime Minister ever could.
2	And in our America , the most generous , optimistic nation on the face of the Earth , we must not and will not rest until every man and
2	And these are just a few of our pending proposals for reform and renewal.
2	And recognizing this was a coalition effort , let us not forget Saudi General Khalid , Britain 's General de la Billiere , or General Roquejeoffre of France ,
2	But we must act this week, when Congress will hold the first of two crucial up-or-down votes.
2	Its passage has made the United States the international leader on this human rights issue.
2	Of course, of course, our hearts go out to the hostages and to their families.
2	The congressional leadership and I both have a job to do in getting it enacted.
2	It is that learning is good in and of itself.
2	Second, we must act to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles used to deliver them.
2	The answer is clear: The world could wait no longer.
2	Our problems are large, but our unified heart is larger.
2	As I look around at all these joyous faces , I remember clearly how many years of dedicated commitment have gone into making this historic new civil rights act
2	The terrible crimes and tortures committed by Saddam's henchmen against the innocent people of Kuwait are an affront to mankind and a challenge to the freedom of all.
2	We're coming home now—proud, confident, heads high.
2	He subjected the people of Kuwait to unspeakable atrocities—and among those maimed and murdered, innocent children.
2	But this election isn't only about competence, for competence is a narrow ideal.
2	And now we must decide.
2	A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.
2	Well, don't you believe it.
2	I will modernize and preserve our technological edge.
2	In this view, the country waits passive while Washington sets the rules.
2	Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a dependable ally, said it all: "We do not bargain over hostages.
2	And only a tiny fraction of goods gets through.
2	You're all right now."
2	And then, specifically, first the ADA ensures that employers covered by the act cannot discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities.
2	And he must be able to define - and lead - a mission.
2	We embrace you for your abilities and for your disabilities, for our similarities and indeed for our differences, for your past courage and your future dreams.
2	Some people who are enjoying our prosperity have forgotten what it's for.
2	Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq.
2	While the world waited, Saddam Hussein met every overture of peace with open contempt.
2	I have many friends to thank tonight.
2	Tonight, the battle has been joined.
2	Moslems and non-Moslems, Arabs and non-Arabs, soldiers from many nations stand shoulder to shoulder, resolute against Saddam Hussein's ambitions.
2	The consequences of the conflict in the Gulf reach far beyond the confines of the Middle East.
2	We will also destroy his chemical weapons facilities.
2	That support will be even more important in the days to come.
2	Generous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front-line nations, such as Turkey and Egypt.
2	Clearly, each and every one of us can find fault with something in this agreement.
2	I have an adopted granddaughter.
2	A victory for unprecedented international cooperation and diplomacy, so well led by our Secretary of State, James Baker.
2	It means teaching troubled children through your presence that there's such a thing as reliable love.
2	And most of all, it will not let our economy slip out of control.
2	America is tired of phony deficit reduction or promise-now, save-later plans.
2	Well, many of our fellow citizens with disabilities are unemployed.
2	If we continue to grow at our current rate, we will be able to produce 30 million jobs in the next eight years.
2	Tonight, I ask every community in this country to make this coming Fourth of July a day of special celebration for our returning troops.
2	As I've pointed out before, conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible.
2	We must let these children be our guides and inspiration.
2	I will encourage merit schools.
2	And the parents who settled hungry Kansas would take their children in from the fields when a teacher came.
2	And American citizens abroad must be protected.
2	Additionally, we and several of our allies always have the option to extract oil from our strategic petroleum reserves if conditions warrant.
2	And I want to thank Sandy Parrino, of course, for her leadership.
2	My opponent says no - but I say yes.
2	That's why Secretary of State Baker and Treasury Secretary Brady have met with many world leaders to underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be shared.
2	We met then in time of war.
2	And something else: to curb the proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic missile and, above all, nuclear technologies.
2	This is an immensely important day, a day that belongs to all of you.
2	What a magnificent job you all are doing.
2	I'll try to hold my charisma in check.
2	They see "community" as a limited cluster of interest groups, locked in odd conformity.
2	I respect old fashioned common sense, and have no great love for the imaginings of social planners.
2	A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders.
2	We will continue to review all options with our allies, but let it be clear: we will not let this aggression stand.
2	And we're very happy about that.
2	I see America as the leader - a unique nation with a special role in the world.
2	All should contribute, but the burden should not be excessive for any one group of programs or people.
2	But here at home there's another threat, a cancer gnawing away at our nation's health.
2	And we saw soldiers who know about honor and bravery and duty and country and the world-shaking power of these simple words.
2	On jobs, my mission is: 30 in 8.
2	Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait.
2	The victory over Iraq was not waged as "a war to end all wars."
2	Listen to Master Sergeant J.P. Kendall of the 82d Airborne: "We're here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas.
2	Well , when given the opportunity to be independent , they will move proudly into the economic mainstream of American life , and that 's what this legislation is
2	An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.
2	And one way you know our opponents know the facts is that to attack the record they have to misrepresent it.
2	The Security Council has imposed mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq, designed to force Iraq to relinquish the spoils of its illegal conquest.
2	One issue Look at the world on this bright August night.
2	From the moment Operation Desert Storm commenced on January 16th until the time the guns fell silent at midnight 1 week ago , this nation has watched its sons
2	It's the toughest deficit reduction package ever, with new enforcement rules to make sure that what we fix now stays fixed.
2	Out of these troubled times , our fifth objective—a new world order—can emerge : a new era—freer from the threat of terror , stronger in the pursuit of justice
2	Tonight we ask you to help us move this agreement forward.
2	First, I ask you to understand how important—and for some, how difficult—this vote is for your Congressmen and Senators.
2	When we are successful—and we will be—we have a real chance at this new world order , an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping
2	But the stark fact remained that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination, and this was intolerable.
2	Our Secretary of State, James Baker, held an historic meeting in Geneva, only to be totally rebuffed.
2	Our work is not done - our force is not spent.
2	I will ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.
2	Things aren't perfect in this country.
2	This principle must be elaborated to provide for Israel's security and recognition and at the same time for legitimate Palestinian political rights.
2	So, tonight I call on the Congress to move forward aggressively on our domestic front.
2	That's why they sweat and toil in the sand and the heat and the sun.
2	It seems to me the Presidency provides an incomparable opportunity for "gentle persuasion."
2	We were practical - but we didn't live only for material things.
2	They're worried it's going to remain strong.
2	We 've all been determined to ensure that it gives flexibility , particularly in terms of the timetable of implementation , and we 've been committed to containing the
2	I've also asked him to raise the plight of the hostages held in Lebanon.
2	It belongs to the regulars, to the reserves, to the National Guard.
2	But what we must remember if we are to be responsible - and compassionate - is that economic growth is the key to our endeavors.
2	As we speak, our nation is standing together against Saddam Hussein's aggression.
2	And I am not going to let anyone take it away from us.
2	Our success in the Gulf will shape not only the new world order we seek but our mission here at home.
2	If we do , the long-term result will be a healthier nation and something more : We will have once again put ourselves on the path of economic growth
2	The truth is, this election is about the beliefs we share, the values we honor, the principles we hold dear.
2	And we'd moved in the wrong direction.
2	A new partnership of nations has begun.
2	In a very real sense , this victory belongs to them—to the privates and the pilots , to the sergeants and the supply officers , to the men and
2	First, we must work together to create shared security arrangements in the region.
2	Yet, in the conflict just concluded, Israel and many of the Arab States have for the first time found themselves confronting the same aggressor.
2	They call for Iraq 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal , the restoration of Kuwait 's legitimate government , and categorically reject Iraq 's cynical and self-serving attempt to annex
2	Instead, he tried to make this a dispute between Iraq and the United States of America.
2	And I learned a few things about life in a place called Texas.
2	And I take those who have guided me personally over the years : of course , my friends Evan Kemp and Justin Dart , up here on the platform
2	I seek the presidency to build a better America.
2	That cancer is the budget deficit.
2	For the sake of our principles, for the sake of the Kuwaiti people, we stood our ground.
2	The legitimate government of Kuwait will be restored to its rightful place, and Kuwait will once again be free.
2	I want power in the hands of parents.
2	His ability to threaten mass destruction is itself destroyed.
2	We will surely have change this year, but will it be change that moves us forward?
2	I am a man who sees life in terms of missions - missions defined and missions completed.
2	And you must know us.
2	This victory belongs to the finest fighting force this nation has ever known in its history.
2	His people have been lied to, denied the truth.
2	With today 's signing of the landmark Americans for Disabilities Act , every man , woman , and child with a disability can now pass through once-closed doors into
2	Ask them to fight for the future of your kids by supporting this budget agreement.
2	Within 3 days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia.
2	And let me say to everyone listening or watching tonight : When the troops we 've sent in finish their work , I am determined to bring them home
2	America and the world will not be blackmailed by this ruthless policy.
2	The recent challenge could not have been clearer.
2	If we fail to enact this agreement, our economy will falter, markets may tumble, and recession will follow.
2	Together, we must remove the physical barriers we have created and the social barriers that we have accepted.
2	Iraq will eventually comply with all relevant United Nations resolutions , and then , when peace is restored , it is our hope that Iraq will live as a
2	Others traveled to Baghdad in a variety of efforts to restore peace and justice.
2	Many worry about your reaction to one part or another.
2	Our economy, our Armed Forces, our energy dependence, and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friends and stand up to our foes.
2	Some say this isn't an election about ideology, it's an election about competence.
2	And that is the idea of community - a beautiful word with a big meaning.
2	Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known.
2	We will do it - by maintaining our commitment to free and fair trade, by keeping government spending down, and by keeping taxes down.
2	But let's be frank.
2	Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect.
2	However, Saddam clearly felt that by stalling and threatening and defying the United Nations, he could weaken the forces arrayed against him.
2	But enduring peace must be our mission.
2	It's a little-known fact, but America's best job creators and greatest innovators tend to be our smaller companies.
2	A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor.
2	I thank God her parents chose life.
2	The day of her christening we wept with joy.
2	My approach this evening is, as Sergeant Joe Friday used to say, "Just the facts, ma'm."
2	But our policy cannot change, and it will not change.
2	Tonight I challenge the young people of our country to shut down the drug dealers around the world.
2	The stakes are high this year and the choice is crucial , for the differences between the two candidates are as deep and wide as they have ever been
2	We went halfway around the world to do what is moral and just and right.
2	They've been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council five times in as many weeks.
2	But for too long, the Nation's business in Washington has been conducted as if these basic rules did not apply.
2	Our first priority is to get this economy rolling again.
2	And third, the Congress should, this month, enact measures to increase domestic energy production and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil.
2	Competence is the creed of the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesn't for a second understand the magic of the machine.
2	We moved to west Texas 40 years ago.
2	This is no time to risk America's capacity to protect her vital interests.
2	The troops know why they're there.
2	It means maintaining a capable U.S. naval presence in the region, just as we have for over 40 years.
2	Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression.
2	It 's time to rise above the parochial and the pork barrel , to do what is necessary , what 's right , and what will enable this nation
2	Already , leaders of several other countries , including Sweden , Japan , the Soviet Union , and all 12 members of the EEC , have announced that they
2	How do we complete it?
2	Any workable solution must be judged as a whole, not piece by piece.
2	First , the Congress should , this month , within a budget agreement , enact growth-oriented tax measures—to help avoid recession in the short term and to increase savings
